ONE is an object show by cheesy hfj. i've been a fan of the genre for the past 8 years at least, which is the majority of my life. i only really liked jacknjellify's shows, but i am still undeniably an object show fan.

this meant when ONE subverted this genre, it was perfect for me. if you're reading this, i'd love to recommend you ONE, but without the context of other object shows, i don't know if it would be as good.
