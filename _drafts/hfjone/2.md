ONE's ending is generally seen as unsatisfying. i strongly agree. the show ends with an awkward episode, where the main character (liam) is now stuck in airy's dimension, with the frequencies lost. there is no way for liam to get home. his only ally is running out of battery, and there's not much he can do. liam discovers that airy is planning to start a 3rd season of ONE, fulfiling his promise of returning the season 2 cast to earth. this is what finally convinces liam to kill airy.

liam meets airy in the forest to question him. after he admits his plan, liam takes an axe, and swings it towards airy. airy trips. liam misses. airy trips again. liam misses again, hitting the tree, and breaking his leg.

it's an awkward scene, with only the sound of rain backrounding liam's clumsy assault. it ends with airy taking liam to the hut, and giving him a splint, mirroring the start of the show.

then, airy slips, and dies.

the end.

what an ending, right? instead of giving a satisfying conclusion, we are left with liam trapped and alone, airy dead from slipping, an unusally empty fight scene, and the rest of the cast stuck in the plane, with no clear future. this ending refuses to let anything be resolved.

__i love this ending.__
