ONE is an object show by cheesy hfj. i've been a fan of the genre for the past 8 years at least, which is the majority of my life. i only really liked jacknjellify's shows, but i am still undeniably an object show fan.

this meant when ONE subverted this genre, it was perfect for me. if you're reading this, i'd love to recommend you ONE, but without the context of other object shows, i don't know if it would be as good.

the show is based on a simple premise. objects from all around the "real world" are transported to the plane, a grassy, empty field that imitates the similar green floors in other object shows. 

from there, the unwilling participants are made to compete in ONE, a gameshow hosted by a monotone, invisible, inexperienced host "airy". they are stripped of their names, instead being named after their object, like in other object shows. they then compete in many weird and boring contests.

the show breaks the genre here by having the contests be more of a background feature instead of the main thing the episodes are focused on. it's not the game show you care about, it's the characters.

from here i'm going to talk about the ending, which is why i'm writing this in the first place, so if you haven't watched it, please do. it's just over 2 hours long, and still very enjoyable without the context of other object shows.
