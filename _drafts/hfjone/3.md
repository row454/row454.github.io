*why is an ending that doesn't conclude anything one of my favorite endings of all time?*

when most people explain what makes this ending good, they explain it very objectively. they will explain that this ending is supposed to parallel abandoned object shows. it's very common for people to begin an object show, and never finish it, and that is what ONE is referencing. a lot of these people disliked the ending being unsatisfying, but liked the commentary on abandoning your creation. i don't like this view. yes, the parallel is there, but it's not why i loved this ending.
 
after watching ONE, i was left feeling empty. the show ended unceremoniously, and now it's over. *what now?*

conventional endings aim to leave the audience feeling like a complete story was told. tension was built up, and released in an enjoyable way that resolves ongoing plotlines. but for every convention, there is an equal and opposite anti-convention. ONE's ending builds up tension, then releases it through the awkward fight scene, and airy slipping. no plotlines are resolved. this left the audience feeling unsatisfied. as the series comes to a close, around the bend plays.
