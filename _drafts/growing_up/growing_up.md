on the 22nd of january, 2024, i bought the domain row666.com for a project i had, and decided to use it to post essays to. since then, i have posted zero essays. for a while the site sat there, with one article, about why i wanted to do this, until i decided it was too sad to just have a post about wanting to make posts. i removed it from the site.

last year, i made a resolution to make something, and post it online. so far, i have failed in this goal. but the year is not over, and this article is my final attempt at completing it. if you're reading this, i did it.

as i write this, it is midnight on 02/12/2024. the first week of december. its full of uncertainty. every aspect of my life is in the air right now. and in two months, i'll be an adult.

im not sure how i want to group this next part, so im doing it both ways:

choose your path (don't worry, you will be able to come back):

[<\-\- grouped by time]({{"/growing_up/time" | relative_url}}) | [grouped by type \-\->]({{"/growing_up/type" | relative_url}})
