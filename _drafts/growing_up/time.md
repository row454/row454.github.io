### the past is full of change:
over the past 2 years i've went through an incredible amount of change. i've learnt how to interpret and express my feelings on art. i've accepted my gender identity. i've rediscovered the love for learning that i had as a young child. i've found the creativity that i thought i never had. i've made several major realisations about the world.

i've experienced real grief for the first time.

that's all to say, that i am in an unimaginably different place than i was 2 years ago.

but thats all set in stone now. and while its fun to analyse my past, i've had a long time to think about it, and i don't have much to say about it anymore.

### the present is full of doubt:

currently, i have no idea who i am. i know my name is rowan. i know i am desperately full of potential, and i know i've felt agony at that fact. i know im not normal, but i don't know in what way. i know i don't want a normal relationship, but i know i don't want to be alone. i know i call myself aromantic and asexual, but i know that i've started to doubt those labels.i don't know if they'll change. . i know im queer, i know im trans, i don't know more than that. i know im not a man, and i know im not a woman, but i don't know my gender. i try not to exist within that system. i know i need to create and i know there's a chance that i never will. i know that the next few years of my life will be spent becoming a computer scientist and a mathematician, but i don't know if im happy about that. i know im not satisfied by it, but i also don't know how to be satisfied when im not allowed to do everything. two subjects isn't enough. five isn't. i don't know where i'll be spending the next 4 years of my life. i know i'll find out soon. i know i'll be fine no matter what. i know i'll have regrets, no matter what. i know i have a lot to look forward to, and i want to keep going, but i know im scared i've made a huge mistake. i've taken a recent interest in plurality, and even though i know im singular, and i know i have no dissociation, i also know that i was an ally before i was queer, and i was interested in the concept of being trans before realising i was trans. plurality normally comes from disorders, so this is different, but i also know that many people think disorders aren't necessary.

i know my name is rowan.
i also know im happy. despite the doubt in my life right now, i know im in a good place, and im happy.
